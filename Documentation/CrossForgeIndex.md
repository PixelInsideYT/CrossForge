# Getting Started
 CrossForge is a cross platform graphics framework for 3D applications on Windows, Linux, and WebAssembly. It is primarily designed for educational purposes and computer graphics research. Hence it focuses solely on OpenGL as graphics API (no DirectX or Vulcan), and features extensive tutorials for computer graphics novices. If you want to learn how 3D application work from the ground up, you are at the right place.

# Why CrossForge?
- lot of very impressive open source graphic engines out there
- most of them tend to support various graphics APIs (Vulcan/DirectX/OpenGL) and abstract away the underlying API
- CrossForge purely focuses on OpenGL with strong focus on compatibility with WebGl, so publication for web pages
- this enables you to solely focus on a single graphics API and write your own code and shaders for it using popular and most  widespread graphics API
- develop desktop and web 3D apps alike with the same code
- perfect for academics in computer graphic
 

# List of features

 + Supported systems: Windows, Linux, and Websites (WebAssembly through Emscripten)
 + Physically based shading and material system
 + Deferred and forward rendering pipelines
 + Holistic self-configuring Shader
 + Default Actors for:
	+ Static models
	+ Skeletal animations
	+ Morph target animations
+ Shadow mapping
